Description: An implementation of STL that provides several enhancements over
    the STL implementation that comes with R.  These enhancements include
    handling missing values, providing higher order (quadratic) loess
    smoothing with automated parameter choices, frequency component smoothing
    beyond the seasonal and trend components, and some basic plot methods for
    diagnostics.
